			<h2>My Hometown ESKİŞEHİR</h2>
			<img src="C:\Users\Mert Sevingit\Desktop\Website hw\image\esk1.jpg" align="left" height="200" width="500" ><p ><br><br>	  &nbsp My homotown Eskişehir is a real good city for living. Although one of the places to visit in Eskisehir is located close to one, you need to visit the city in 3-4 parts. You can start by visiting the Odunpazarı district. There are many historic and tourist attractions in this area. From there you can walk to the city center to reach the Porsuk Creek and the ADALAR Region. You can also take time to Sazova Park, Waterfall Park and Kentpark which are popular and valuable parks of Eskisehir.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
