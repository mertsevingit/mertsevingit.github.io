					<p><h3>About Me</h3> Hello dear friends. I'm Mert Sevingit. I was born in 1994 in Eskişehir. I studied primary school, middle school and high school in Eskişehir. In short, my whole life passed here and is passing :). And I am a student of computer engineering at Anadolu University. This is my fifth year in this school and I am in third class right now. If I have to talk a bit more about myself, I should give an example of my personal characteristics. I am a curious and impatient person. So I always focus on results. Sometimes this can lead to bad situations, but not from the personalities that I can change. I am a stubborn person so I do not stop until I succeed in what I want to do. I hope the school finishes and I am become a successful computer engineer.

					<h3>My Hobbies</h3>
					<p>
					
					Watching movies and listening to music is one of my main hobbies. I can watch movies for hours without get bored. Also I love travel so I joined Work and Travel Program in 2013 and went to Usa. Then last year I saw some European Countries. In addition I am curious about football because of that I broke my arm 2 times. Then I had to quit playing football. But at least right know I can watch futbol matches without broke my arm :).
